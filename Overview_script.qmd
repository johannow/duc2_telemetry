## Script1

In the first script the acoustic telemetry data is downloaded.

A dataframe is created based on the raw data with daily information on the amount of counts of distinct fish at different stations with their respective longitude and latitude. Also the amount of total active tags in the water on a given day is given as this biases the count information.
