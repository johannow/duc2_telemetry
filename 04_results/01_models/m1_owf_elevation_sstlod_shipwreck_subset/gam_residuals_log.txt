📘 *Interpretation Help*

1️⃣ QQ Plot / Uniformity Test
- Checks if residuals follow the expected distribution under the model.
- Look for: points near 45° line; no S-shape or curvature.
✓ Result: No significant deviation (residual distribution looks OK).

2️⃣ Dispersion Test
- Tests if residual variance matches expectations.
- Red line = observed SD; histogram = simulated SD.
✓ Result: No dispersion problems detected.

3️⃣ Outlier Test
- Checks if there are more extreme residuals than expected.
✓ Result: Outlier count within expected range.
